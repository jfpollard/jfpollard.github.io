# Paceline / John Pollard

I have a track record of growth and value creation via technical and GTM innovation, operational excellence, and building motivated teams that delight customers and perform financially.

I have been able to ID disruptive technology trends, develop compelling vision and strategy, and execute at scale. Consumer targeted software in the early 90s at **Microsoft**. Web e-commerce in the first founding years of **Expedia**. Mobile device software and services at **Jott** (a company I founded and sold). Speech Recognition, Messaging and ML at **Nuance**. The application of data science at massive scale at **Amazon**. The exploding need for larger namespaces at **Identity Digital**. Most recently, the application of AI in the legal services sector at **Lighthouse**.

## Paceline's "model"

No matter what stage of the journey you are in as a company, I've been there and can help. Whether it's a few hours of conversation, or more full time engagement, I'm at a point in my career where I can just lend a hand.

## Relevant experience, and skills I offer

* **C-level leadership** including being the founding CEO at two startups which exited: strategy development and flow down to goals, metrics and execution; raising venture or PE capital, and allocating it; organization design; tricky personnel matters, interviewing talent.

* **Board engagement** as a CEO and operating executive: operating / financial reporting; special projects; exit planning and execution.

* **Applying AI and Machine Learning** both as solution or offering, but also in achieving efficiency and scale: identifying areas of opportunity; describing value (and pricing) to clients; building execution capability.

* **M&A** on both buy and sell side: build/buy analyses; Board presentations; due diligence; integration; GTM.

* **Performance improvement** in turnaround and scale up situations: strategy alignment and goal setting; resource planning; etc.

* **Product and GTM performance** at innovation-driven companies: getting to product market fit; GTM alignment and execution; pricing; competitive analysis.
